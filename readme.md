# üèõÔ∏èüóΩ Scraping The New York State Senate

# Goal
To see how the state's lawmaking priorities have changed over the years.

# Summary
I collected data about bills signed by the governor from [NYS senate's website](https://www.nysenate.gov/) starting from the 2009-2010 session all the way up to 2021-2022, as of April 29, 2022. At the time of the scrape, New York's Governor Kathy Hochul had signed over 1000 bills into laws. I wanted to see what categories of laws these bills represent ‚Äî are there more public health related laws signed this year? Is the focus on environment protection related laws? How have the laws enacted changed overtime? To take a closer look, I made a database of all laws passed, along with their dates, sponsor, descriptions and the law sections they affect.

# Process and tech stack used

#### Data collection
- The dataset contains 5052 rows and 6 columns. For the scrape, I used [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), which is a Python Library.
- All the pages I scraped ‚Äî 510 ‚Äî to get the names of all the laws, and then another 5052 pages to get law sections were luckily all fairly standardized in how the html was structured. This meant that I could write a function that was applicable universally!
- The code and function can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/areenaarora/new-york-senate_scrape/blob/main/Ten-year-scrape.ipynb). The notebook has comments and walk through of how the code works.

#### Analyses
- Once extracted, I analysed the data in a separate notebook. The intial questions I wanted to ask were:
1. How many laws were signed in each session?
2. What were the major categories of laws signed?
